🔗 Front Page

✅ What’s Working Well:

Strong opening message: “We simplify logistics in Southeast Asia” is clear and aligned with what eCommerce brands care about.

CTAs like “Get in Touch” and “Get Started” are visible and effective for conversion.

Clean, modern, and startup-forward design.

❌ What Could Be Improved:

Lacks customer logos, case studies, or testimonials — no social proof.

Missing ICP-specific messaging (e.g., tailored examples for fashion, electronics, etc.).

💡 Suggestions:

Add a “Trusted by” section, shipment stats, and a lane coverage map.

Include a live chat widget to improve lead capture and engagement.

🔗 Solutions Page

✅ What’s Working Well:

Covers Cross-border, Fulfilment, Last-mile, and Customs clearly.

Clean visual layout, good for skimming.

❌ What Could Be Improved:

Lacks visual elements and concrete differentiators.

No industry-specific examples that help drive relevance during outreach.

💡 Suggestions:

Add short examples per vertical (e.g., fashion brands during peak season).

Include 2–3 USPs per service to help Janio stand out.

🔗 Services Page

✅ What’s Working Well:

Simple layout and quick overview of services.

Reinforces end-to-end capabilities from freight to last-mile.

❌ What Could Be Improved:

Lacks a visual flow to show how services are connected.

All service blocks look the same — no icons or visual differentiation.

💡 Suggestions:

Add a flow diagram (e.g., Freight → Customs → Fulfilment → Last Mile).

Include interactive or bundled solutions based on client types.

🔗 About Page

✅ What’s Working Well:

Clear mission statement.

Mentions regional presence and strong delivery network.

❌ What Could Be Improved:

No founding info, milestones, team bios, or industry focus.

Missing social proof, leadership faces, or press mentions.

💡 Suggestions:

Add a timeline, leadership mini-bios, CEO quotes, and case studies.

Include SEA coverage map and logos of clients/partners.

🔗 Contact Page

✅ What’s Working Well:

Simple layout and short form = low friction for inbound leads.

❌ What Could Be Improved:

No confirmation message or expectations after submission.

No links to socials or alternative contact methods.

💡 Suggestions:

Add a line like: “We’ll get back to you within 1–2 business days.”

Include LinkedIn or WhatsApp icons, and explore a live chat feature.

🎙️ Transcript Summary & Meeting Insights



Key Discussion Points:

JK’s feedback suggests the need to rework the site’s messaging and add 3–4 new landing pages focused on cost-conscious and last-mile logistics users.

I shared visual/UI feedback, highlighting the need for:

Customer logos and testimonials

A live chat feature (with optional routing)

Differentiator/competitor section (updated regularly)

A more humanized About section (timelines, bios, CEO quotes)

We also discussed the copyright font issue that currently limits our use of social media icons.

You mentioned aligning with JK later to review this and allocate time for updates.

Action Items Recap:

✅ I’ve summarized all my feedback via this email.

🔜 You to follow up with JK to align on messaging and timelines.
